---Section One (Ripper)---
--Done--Create working settings.json file so that users can modify select information that may differ between computers
    --Done--Have the base location for rips be customizable through the settings.json file
        --Done--New folder will have to be generated before running console as the console won't do this for you
         folder will also have to be passed as a var so that the command can pick it up and append it to the file path
         Ripping command: "makemkvcon.exe -r mkv disc:{driveNameVar} {titleNumberVar} "SettingJson configured filepath\{DVDFolderVar}""
            Ex: makemkvcon.exe -r mkv disc:0 0 "C:\MovieRips\MyMovie"
--Done--Interpert DVD drives with discs loaded and write drive names to vars to be called later
    Use command "makemkvcon.exe -r info DRV:index > "node directory\DriveLog.txt"" (inside of MakeMKV directory) to get DriveLog.txt file to use to pull drive names from
        Ex: makemkvcon.exe -r info DRV:index > "C:\AutoRip\logs\DriveLog.txt"
--Done--Pass each drive name var individually into title gen command
    "makemkvcon.exe -r info disc:{driveNameVar} > "node directory\TitlesLog.txt"" (inside of MakeMKV directory) This generates the TitlesLog.txt file
        Ex: makemkvcon.exe -r info disc:0 > "C:\AutoRip\logs\TitlesLog.txt"
--Done--use that TitlesLog.txt file to get the longest title and add that title number (in console format i.e. 0,1,2 not 1,2,3) to a var that can be called later
--Done--Call the title number var into the dvd rip command to rip that disc to desired location
--Done--Be able to rip all DVDs loged to vars one at a time without restarting code (i.e. run file once and it'll rip all dvds one at a time)
--Done--Publish to GitHub
--Done--Add time stamps to log messages
--Done--Add char subtractors to remove chars that aren't valid in a file name from being used to generate folder names
--Done--Add Batch file into release version
--Done--Add Exit section to exit out of AutoRip when it's run from a bat file
--Done--Fix config file so that AutoRip.js actually calls it
--Done--Fix Ripping so that DVDs rip synchronously insted of asynchronously
--Done--Clean up and reorganize code to be more readable (due to the mess caused by the syncronous conversion update)
--Done--Fix GitHub settings so that node packages are not tracked (i.e. they are manually downloaded by the end user) so that Git download package is smaller
--Done--Add windows batch file so the user can install node packages without downloading them in the git package or typing the command manually
--Done--Add color messages to make console more readable
--On Hold--Fix config file so that single slashes can be used
Add MakeMKV file validation to ensure MakeMKV is installed and running an acceptable version
Add exception handling in sections that lack it
    True successfully saved MSG codes
        MSG:5005 - X titles saved
        MSG:5036 - Copy complete X titles saved
    True Failed to save MSG codes
        MSG:3042 - IFO file for VTS #X is corrupt, VOB file must be scanned... (this one may not always return fail)
        MSG:3035 - Cellwalk algorithm failed trying calltrim algorithm
        MSG:3002 - Calculated BUP offset for VTS #X does not match one in IFO header (this may be the most accurate "fail" message code)
        MSG:5010 - Failed to open disc
Add logging option to send all STDout messages to log files instead of keeping them hidden in variables
Add feature to delete folders created for failed discs
Fix issues with some bluray discs not ripping for some reason (may be an unfixable disc speific issue)
    Must run a bluray through the raw console to discover the error
Add info in README file regarding best settings to set in the graphical MakeMKV app since the console pulls settings from it
--Done--Add ability for user to send logs to file and choose log path

---Section Two (Stream Transcoder)---
Setup cluster rendering for Handbrake (render same file on ZacAcePC and RHU1 at the same time using Handbrake)
    This may be a part of a seperate github project or not published at all (still unsure at this time)
--More tasks to come--
