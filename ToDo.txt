---Section One (Ripper)---
Create working settings.json file so that users can modify select information that may differ between computers
    Have the base location for rips be customizable through the settings.json file
        --Done--New folder will have to be generated before running console as the console won't do this for you
         folder will also have to be passed as a var so that the command can pick it up and append it to the file path
         Ripping command: "makemkvcon.exe -r mkv disc:{driveNameVar} {titleNumberVar} "SettingJson configured filepath\{DVDFolderVar}""
            Ex: makemkvcon.exe -r mkv disc:0 0 "C:\MovieRips\MyMovie"
--Done--Interpert DVD drives with discs loaded and write drive names to vars to be called later
    Use command "makemkvcon.exe -r info DRV:index > "node directory\DriveLog.txt"" (inside of MakeMKV directory) to get DriveLog.txt file to use to pull drive names from
        Ex: makemkvcon.exe -r info DRV:index > "C:\AutoRip\logs\DriveLog.txt"
--Done--Pass each drive name var individually into title gen command
    "makemkvcon.exe -r info disc:{driveNameVar} > "node directory\TitlesLog.txt"" (inside of MakeMKV directory) This generates the TitlesLog.txt file
        Ex: makemkvcon.exe -r info disc:0 > "C:\AutoRip\logs\TitlesLog.txt"
--Done--use that TitlesLog.txt file to get the longest title and add that title number (in console format i.e. 0,1,2 not 1,2,3) to a var that can be called later
--Done--Call the title number var into the dvd rip command to rip that disc to desired location
--Done--Be able to rip all DVDs loged to vars one at a time without restarting code (i.e. run file once and it'll rip all dvds one at a time)
--Done--Publish to GitHub
Fix Ripping so that DVDs rip synchronously insted of asynchronously
--Done--Add time stamps to log messages
--Done--Add char subtractors to remove chars that aren't valid in a file name from being used to generate folder names
--Done--Add Batch file into release version
Add MakeMKV file validation to ensure MakeMKV is installed and running an acceptable version
Add exception handling in sections that lack it

---Section Two (Stream Transcoder)---
Setup cluster rendering for Handbrake (render same file on ZacAcePC and RHU1 at the same time using Handbrake)
    This may be a part of a seperate github project or not published at all (still unsure at this time)
--More tasks to come--
