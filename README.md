# General Info
The current version of MakeMKV Auto Rip (0.1.0) can be adapted to work in any system with MakeMKV installed but requires that the user manually modify the AutoRip.js file to change the location of movie rips and to change the install location of MakeMKV

MakeMKV is not included in this software and it never will be, however, the use of this software is dependent upon MakeMKV and as such the end user should download and install it from the MakeMKV website on any system where MakeMKV Auto Rip will be used.

MakeMKV Auto Rip is only intended to run on windows based machines and will only be tested for Windows 10 unless stated otherwise, should you wish to attempt to run this software on a different operating system you are free to do so but should go into the endeavor with the knowledge that MakeMKV Auto Rip has never been tested for such a scenario.
